Purpose:  This allows you to animate a skeleton so you can use the animations in games.  

Use:
Click on any bone.  If you hold the left mouse down, you can spin around the bone and its children.  If you hold both buttons down, you can move the bone.  Since the mouse movement is strange there are keys too.

Keyboard keys are(after you select a bone):
f,r,e,d,c,q,a,z,w,x
If you hold shift, the key press moves opposite.

If you hold ctrl, the keys move slower.

Home = undo
End = redo

Function keys
f6-Takes a snapshot of the skeleton.  To understand this, take a shot of the skeleton, then move a bone, then take another shot of the skeleton. Close both windows
f1- Plays the animation.  If you have two frames taken, you can play the animation.
f5- Menu
f8- Save animation
f7- Load animation
f4- Load skeleton
f3- Save akeleton

Extra information:
With the window you get from pressing f6, you can change the speed at which the animation plays by changing the 1000 to a different number of ms.


Known issues:
1) Not heavily tested, so bugs may appear.
2) The disconnect(shift + 'o')/reconnect('o') mesh command could cause issues.
